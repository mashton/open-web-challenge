# Challenge areas
Governance is probably the most important problem in the world, because it's often the one standing in the way of solving every other problem. And it's hard. To help you scope out your projects, we've identified a range of challenge areas motivated by NEAR's own governance problems. Think of these as inspirations and starting points.

# The DAO hack (but this time for good)
This hackathon is a bit special: we're running it *entirely through DAOs*. That means you'll need to register through a DAO and that the vast majority of hackathon prizes will be awarded through a DAO on NEAR to a DAO that you create. To make that prospect sweeter, we're encouraging people to get onboard early with $5,000 in prizes. To qualify, all you have to do is register a SputnikDAO for your project within the first week of the hackathon, have a council with your team as voting members, and submit some documentation of your current progress to Metagov DAO. And we promise, we'll fund you ;)

# Judging criteria
Challenge entries will be judged on four criteria:

* **Impactful**: does the project solve a specific problem, generate meaningful information, or benefit a wide section of the open web ecosystem?
* **Creative**: how is the project different (and better) from previous alternatives? Be audacious.
* **Realistic**: is the project do-able, whether commercially, technologically, or politically? We know things can be complicated. But tell us how you plan on overcoming the obstacles.
* **Collaborative**: does the project interact with other projects, NEAR Councils, or DAOs? Engage with the ecosystem. Do your research, and tap into what other makers have already built. 

We want to emphasize something: *entries do not have to be technical*. We encourage a mix of technical and social innovation---remember, blockchain itself is, at its core, a social innovation as well as a technical one!

# Introducing the new tools of governance
1. [Sputnik DAO](https://sputnik.fund/): NEAR's premier DAO technology, Sputnik DAOs offer an easy, accessible platform for collective decision-making on the blockchain
2. [Metagov](http://docs.metagov.org/): a unified API gateway providing access to a bunch of governance services; designed to support rapid prototyping of governance experiments
3. [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io): SourceCred is a reputation algorithm helps communities measure and reward value creation
4. [PolicyKit]: ...
