# More information

## Problem Definition
For this challenge, teams will create decentralized autonomous organizations in order to coordinate and make decisions collectively. We recommend participants write descriptions of a real-world problem solved by their project or specific goals with explanations.

Team leaders can launch Sputnik DAOs to enable voting on proposals of several types, including payouts, council membership (add / remove), updating parameters, and changing the purpose. The problem chosen should consider the features in our Sputnik DAO v2.

## Success Criteria
Your team will define your own success criteria by submitting proposals to incentivize actions in pursuit of a vision. Meeting the success criteria demonstrates that your team solves a problem. In our meta-example, NEAR is building a family of DAOs to coordinate an event like this one.

Keep in mind, the original purpose of Sputnik’s Genesis DAO is to develop Sputnik DAO as a technology and to grow the intergalactic mesh of satellite organizations.

Here is an example of success criteria that might be appropriate:

* Giving NEAR to artists who create valuable things and experiences
* Joining as many councils as possible
* Large number of proposals and high participation rate

After a month, teams will demonstrate how their solutions actually meet success criteria.

### Examples
* Rare Art Festival council forms to reward contributors, then coordinates an event in May
* Open Sourcery Guild forms a group of councils to embark on a perilous journey
* Createbase
* SeedClub
* Abridged
* TEC
* Gitcoin

The judges will be looking for teams to demonstrate cooperation and communication, even if they are in different organizations. Councils may interact and receive bonus points…

## Rules for Participating DAOs / Councils
DAOs must have a council with voting members, formed by a registered event participant.
The role of a council member is to help other participants build solutions, according to strategic goals based on the purpose of that DAO.
DAO participants can be members of more than one council.

# Spirit of the Challenge

## OpenWeb.Community
This Open Web Sandbox emphasizes the importance of real community and governance for any project, otherwise known as the Spirit of the Challenge. For this event, Sputnik DAO councils will design, develop, and document purposeful solutions.

Teams are highly encouraged to design and build their own decentralized organizations. Use of existing plans for reference and inspiration is allowed. All plans, and the source of those plans, must be documented in the DAO.

## Important Note Regarding the Rules
Clarifications and additions to the rules may be made. When changes occur, registered teams will be alerted by email. Teams are encouraged to monitor the website for changes. The website should also include answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) which are posted and updated periodically.

## Towards a Governance Experiment
Your DAO will serve as part of a governance research initiative led by NEAR and the Metagovernance Project! 

Please contribute to this experiment by documenting your experience launching a decentralized organization for the purpose of connecting and collaborating. We are hoping to use this conceptual framework to analyze both individual and group agency dynamics in the context of DAO interoperability.
